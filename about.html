    <h3>About</h3>
   <p>Hi I'm Danaeja Trogdon. I attend Western High School located in Baltimore, Maryland. I myself am not a big sports fan, but I have no problem supporting my hometown teams which are: The Baltimore Ravens, The Orioles, and The Maryland Terps.  I am mostly interested in the genre comedy. But my favorite television shows are Law & Order: Special Vicims Unit, Pretty Little Liars, The Fosters, and Stitchers. My favorite movies are made from Tyler Perry: which include Good Deeds, and Temptation. </p>
   <p>As I stated above I attend Western High School, but I didn't always attend that school. My freshman year in high school I attened a charter school in Baltimore, Maryland called Baltimore Freedom Academy. That school was shut down, so I was moved to Western. While I attended Baltimore Freedom Academy, I played on the Volleyball team. The volleyball team just so happened to be the only sport I got to play at that school. Moving to Western, I knew it was a much more harder school, so my first year there I had no intention on playing a sport. My junior year I wanted to join something so to tried numerous clubs but I wasn't interested in any of them. Finally I decided to join the robotics team, I felt like I belonged, I loved the people, and I was learning something new & very interesting. </p>
   <p> My thoughts on my career just happen to be surrounded by computers. After attending Code in the Schools, I am strongly considering going into web design, sometimes it is challenging but I am not willing to take the time and effort to learn all the skills I need to move on into a career such as this. </p>
	<p>I have not visited many placed in my liftime. In fact I've only visited Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, DC, and Pennsylvania. My life long dream is to visit Egypt. I am so interested in Egypt. I actually researched Cairo, Egypt so if you'd like to see more about Cairo, feel free to click Egypt at the top of the page.

				 Cairo is the Capital of Egypt. It's the largest city in the Middle East and Africa. Before Cairo was the captial of Egypt. A city called Memphis was the capital of Ancient Egypt (founded around 3100 B.C.E by Menes). Menes was the first Pharaoh, he unified upper and lower Egypt. But he didn't want it to seem like he favored one part of Egypt more than the other so he built the capital "Memphis" on the border between the two. It was originally called Men-nefer, but the Greeks later called it Memphis

        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>
         Cairo was founded by the Fatimid Dynasty in 969 C.E. The Fatimids were led by General Gawhar to establish a new capital for them. Near 200 years later, Egypts administrative centre remained in Fustat, but when the Fatimids set fire to Fustat, Egypt was permanently moved to Cairo. al-Qahira is the offical name of the city, it means "The Subduer". The name Cairo is believed to come from the Arabic name of Planet Mars, Which was rising on the day the city was founded.
